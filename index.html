<!-- The if directive
With the if directive you can conditionally skip a section of the template.
For example, assume that in the very first example you want to greet your boss, Big Joe, differently than other users:
-->

<html>
<head>
  <title>Welcome!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>
    Welcome ${user}<#if user == "Big Joe">, our beloved leader</#if>!
  </h1>
  <p>Our latest product:
  <a href="${latestProduct.url}">${latestProduct.name}</a>!
</body>
</html>

<!-- Here you have told FreeMarker that the ", our beloved leader" should be there only if the value of the variable user is equal to the string "Big Joe".
In general, things between <#if condition> and </#if> tags are skipped if condition is false (the boolean value).

Let's look at condition more closely: == is an operator that tests if the values at its left and right side are equivalent,
and the results is a boolean value, true or false accordingly.
On the left side of == I have referenced a variable with the syntax that should be already familiar;
this will be replaced with the value of the variable. In general, unquoted words inside directives or interpolations are treated as references to variables.
 On the right side I have specified a literal string. Literal strings in templates must always be put inside quotation marks. -->

 <!--This will print "Pythons are free today!" if their price is 0:-->

<#if animals.python.price == 0>
  Pythons are free today!
</#if>


<!-- With the <#else> tag you can specify what to do if the condition is false. For example: -->

<#if animals.python.price < animals.elephant.price>
  Pythons are cheaper than elephants today.
<#else>
  Pythons are not cheaper than elephants today.
</#if>

<!-- This prints "Pythons are cheaper than elephants today.
" if the price of python is less than the price of elephant, or else it prints "Pythons are not cheaper than elephants today."
 You can refine this further by using elseif: -->

 <#if animals.python.price < animals.elephant.price>
  Pythons are cheaper than elephants today.
<#elseif animals.elephant.price < animals.python.price>
  Elephants are cheaper than pythons today.
<#else>
  Elephants and pythons cost the same today.
</#if>

<!--
The list directive
This is needed when you want to list something.
For example if you merge this template with the data-model used earlier to demonstrate sequences: -->

<p>We have these animals:
<table border=1>
  <#list animals as animal> <!-- "animals" is a just a variable -->
    <tr><td>${animal.name}<td>${animal.price} Euros
  </#list>
</table>
<!-- then the output will be: -->

<p>We have these animals:
<table border=1>
    <tr><td>mouse<td>50 Euros
    <tr><td>elephant<td>5000 Euros
    <tr><td>python<td>4999 Euros
</table>


<!-- The generic form of the list directive is: <#list sequence as loopVariable>repeatThis</#list>.
The repeatThis part will be repeated for each item in the sequence that you have specified with sequence,
 one after the other, starting from the first item. In all repetitions loopVariable will hold the value of the current item.
 This variable exists only between the <#list ...> and </#list> tags.

The sequence can be any kind of expression. For example we could list the fruits of the example data model like this:
-->
<ul>
<#list misc.fruits as fruit> <!-- The misc.fruits expression should be familiar to you; it references a variable in the data-model.-->
  <li>${fruit}
</#list>
</ul>
